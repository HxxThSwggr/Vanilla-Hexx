# #'s Lovely Vanilla Modpack
A minecraft modpack of mods I play with. Nothing game changing in the sense of the game's content. Mainly optimization and make-up.

#### mod_list.txt
  Lists all the mods and links to their download (preferably Modrinth, then CurseForge, then whatever).

#### ferium_config.json
  A Ferium config with one profile including all the mods, even the ones not yet available for 1.19.
  You can copy the profile to your own Ferium config for easy updating, but dont forget to put in the actual directory behind *"output_dir":* .
