# #'s Lovely Vanilla Modpack
A minecraft modpack of mods I play with. Nothing game changing in the sense of the game's content. Mainly optimization and make-up.

## Lists
#### mod_list.txt
All mods and links to their download (preferably [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/), then [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods), then whatever).

#### resourcepack_list.txt
All resourcepacks, their download pages and order.

#### shaderpack_list.txt
All (two) shaderpacks and their (one) download page.

## .minecraft
A .minecraft folder with the mods' configs and shaderpacks' settings.

## Ferium
#### ferium_config.json
A [Ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium) config with one profile including all the mods, even the ones not yet available for 1.19.
You can copy the profile to your own Ferium config for easy updating, but dont forget to put in the actual directory behind *"output_dir":* .
